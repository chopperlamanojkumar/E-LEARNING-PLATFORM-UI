*Description*

*This project is a responsive and interactive E-Learning platform built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a clean interface where users can view available courses, track their learning progress, and watch embedded tutorial videos.

The layout includes a header with navigation, a course listing section displaying each course along with animated progress bars, and a progress tracker summarizing the learnerâ€™s completion status. Each course contains a dynamic progress bar that updates its fill level based on a data-progress attribute, animated smoothly using JavaScript and styled via CSS transitions. Additionally, YouTube videos are embedded under each course for guided learning.

Styled with a modern card-based UI, shadow effects, and responsive grid layouts, the platform ensures both usability and visual appeal, offering learners an engaging and structured way to continue their education online.*
